# PZ-ClothingUI

This mod was created to provide a better overview of equipped items. Often, it was not very clear to me which clothing goes to which slot. I found no similliar, so I decided to create one.

## How to add translation
1. Go into a folder `media/lua/shared/Translate`
1. Copy the folder `EN` 
2. Rename the folder to the code of your language, you can find them [here](https://github.com/TheIndieStone/ProjectZomboidTranslations)
3. Change the name of the file from `UI_EN` to `UI_YOURCODE`
4. Change the first line of the file from `UI_EN` to `UI_YOURCODE`
5. Translate the texts in the file. 

In case you don't know how to work with GIT, please create a new [ISSUE](https://github.com/rempAut/PZ-ClothingUI/issues)/[thread on steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/discussions/2695471997) with translated file and we can add that file to the project.
